Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American politician, media personality, and businessman who served as the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021. Having won the 2024 presidential election as the nominee of the Republican Party, he is the president-elect and is scheduled to be inaugurated as the 47th president on January 20, 2025.

Trump graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Becoming president of the family real estate business in 1971, he focused on luxury accommodation. After a series of bankruptcies in the 1990s, he launched side ventures, mostly by licensing the Trump name. From 2004 to 2015, he produced and hosted the reality television series The Apprentice.

Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican nominee. His election and policies sparked numerous protests. He ordered a travel ban targeting Muslims and refugees, expanded the U.S.–Mexico border wall, and implemented a family separation policy. He rolled back more than 100 environmental policies and regulations, signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and appointed three justices to the Supreme Court. He initiated a trade war with China in 2018 and withdrew the U.S. from international agreements on climate, trade, and the nuclear program of Iran. He met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un without progress on denuclearization. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, he downplayed its severity, contradicted guidance from international public health bodies, and signed the CARES Act economic stimulus. He was impeached in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and in 2021 for incitement of insurrection; the Senate acquitted him in both cases.

Trump's politics and rhetoric led to the Trumpism movement. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged, racist, and misogynistic. He promoted conspiracy theories and extensively made false and misleading statements during his campaigns and presidency, to a degree unprecedented in American politics. After his first term, scholars and historians ranked him as one of the worst presidents in American history. He lost the 2020 presidential election but did not concede, falsely claiming widespread electoral fraud and attempting to overturn the results, including through his involvement in the January 6 Capitol attack. In civil proceedings, Trump was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation in 2023, and financial fraud in 2024. In May 2024, he was found guilty of falsifying business records, making him the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony. He faced more felony indictments related to his interference in the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents, which were dismissed after his victory in the 2024 election.

Early life and education

Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at Jamaica Hospital in Queens, New York City, the fourth child of Fred Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump.[1] He is of German and Scottish descent.[2] He grew up with his older siblings, Maryanne, Fred Jr., and Elizabeth, and his younger brother, Robert, in a mansion in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens.[3]

Trump attended the private college-preparatory Kew-Forest School through seventh grade.[4] He was a difficult child and showed an early interest in his father's business.[5] His father enrolled him in New York Military Academy, a private boarding school, to complete secondary school;[6] he learned to excel in a strict regimen.[7]

In 1964, Trump enrolled at Fordham University. Two years later, he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania,[8] graduating in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science in economics.[9] He was exempted from the draft during the Vietnam War due to bone spurs in his heels.[10] In 2015, he threatened his high school, colleges, and the College Board with legal action if they released his academic records.[11]

Family
In 1977, Trump married the Czech model Ivana Zelníčková.[12] They had three children: Donald Jr. (1977–), Ivanka (1981–), and Eric (1984–). The couple divorced in 1990, following his affair with the actress Marla Maples.[13] He and Maples married in 1993 and divorced in 1999. They have one daughter, Tiffany (1993–), whom Maples raised in California.[14] In 2005, he married the Slovenian model Melania Knauss.[15] They have one son, Barron (2006–).[16]

Health
Trump says he has never drunk alcohol, smoked cigarettes, or used drugs.[17][18] He sleeps about four or five hours a night.[19][20] He has called golfing his "primary form of exercise", but usually does not walk the course.[21] He considers exercise a waste of energy because he believes the body is "like a battery, with a finite amount of energy", which is depleted by exercise.[22][23] In 2015, his campaign released a letter from his longtime personal physician, Harold Bornstein, stating that he would "be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency".[24] In 2018, Bornstein said Trump had dictated the contents of the letter and that three of Trump's agents had seized his medical records in a February 2017 raid on Bornstein's office.[24][25]

Views
Many of Trump's comments and actions have been described as racist.[26] In national polling, about half of respondents said that he is racist; a greater proportion believed that he emboldened racists.[27] Several studies and surveys found that racist attitudes fueled his political ascent and were more important than economic factors in determining the allegiance of Trump voters.[28] Racist and Islamophobic attitudes are a powerful indicator of support for Trump.[29] He has also been accused of racism for insisting a group of black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989 Central Park jogger case, even after they were exonerated in 2002 when the actual rapist confessed and his DNA matched the evidence. In October 2024, the men sued Trump for defamation after he said in a televised September debate that they had committed the crime and killed the woman.[30]

In 2011, when he was reportedly considering a presidential run, Trump became the leading proponent of the racist "birther" conspiracy theory, alleging that Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the U.S.[31] In April, he claimed credit for pressuring the White House to publish the "long-form" birth certificate, which he considered fraudulent, and later said this made him "very popular".[32] In September 2016, amid pressure, he acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S.[33] In 2017, he reportedly expressed birther views privately.[34]

Answering questions about the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville
Trump has a history of belittling women when speaking to the media and on social media.[35][36] He made lewd comments, disparaged women's physical appearances, and referred to them using derogatory epithets.[36] At least 25 women publicly accused him of sexual misconduct, including rape, kissing without consent, groping, looking under women's skirts, and walking in on naked teenage pageant contestants. He has denied the allegations.[37] In October 2016, a 2005 "hot mic" recording surfaced in which Trump bragged about kissing and groping women without their consent, saying that, "when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab 'em by the pussy."[38] Trump characterized the comments as "locker-room talk",[39][40] and the incident's widespread media exposure led to Trump's first public apology during his 2016 presidential campaign.[41]

Real estate

Starting in 1968, Trump was employed at his father's real estate company, Trump Management, which owned racially segregated middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs.[43][44] In 1971, his father made him president of the company and he began using the Trump Organization as an umbrella brand.[45]

Roy Cohn was Trump's fixer, lawyer, and mentor for 13 years in the 1970s and 1980s.[46] In 1973, Cohn helped Trump countersue the U.S. government for $100 million (equivalent to $686 million in 2023)[47] over its charges that Trump's properties had racial discriminatory practices. Trump's counterclaims were dismissed, and the government's case was settled with the Trumps signing a consent decree agreeing to desegregate.[48] Cohn introduced political consultant Roger Stone to Trump, who enlisted Stone's services to deal with the federal government.[49]

Between 1991 and 2009, he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for six of his businesses: the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, the casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and the Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts company.[50]

Manhattan and Chicago developments
Trump attracted public attention in 1978 with the launch of his family's first Manhattan venture, the renovation of the derelict Commodore Hotel, adjacent to Grand Central Terminal.[51] The financing was facilitated by a $400 million city property tax abatement arranged for him by his father who also, jointly with Hyatt, guaranteed a $70 million bank construction loan.[44][52] The hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel,[53] and that same year, he obtained rights to develop Trump Tower, a mixed-use skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.[54] The building houses the headquarters of the Trump Corporation and Trump's PAC and was his primary residence until 2019.[55]

In 1988, Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel with a loan from a consortium of sixteen banks.[56] The hotel filed for bankruptcy protection in 1992, and a reorganization plan was approved a month later, with the banks taking control of the property.[57] In 1995, he defaulted on over $3 billion of bank loans, and the lenders seized the Plaza Hotel along with most of his other properties in a "vast and humiliating restructuring" that allowed him to avoid personal bankruptcy.[58][59] The lead bank's attorney said of the banks' decision that they "all agreed that he'd be better alive than dead".[58]

In 1996, Trump acquired and renovated the mostly vacant 71-story skyscraper at 40 Wall Street, later rebranded as the Trump Building.[60] In the early 1990s, he won the right to develop a 70-acre (28 ha) tract in the Lincoln Square neighborhood near the Hudson River. Struggling with debt from other ventures in 1994, he sold most of his interest in the project to Asian investors, who financed the project's completion, Riverside South.[61]

Trump's last major construction project was the 92-story mixed-use Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago which opened in 2008. In 2024, the New York Times and ProPublica reported that the Internal Revenue Service was investigating whether he had twice written off losses incurred through construction cost overruns and lagging sales of residential units in the building he had declared to be worthless on his 2008 tax return.[62]

In 1984, Trump opened Harrah's at Trump Plaza, a hotel and casino, with financing and management help from the Holiday Corporation.[63] It was unprofitable, and he paid Holiday $70 million in May 1986 to take sole control.[64] In 1985, he bought the unopened Atlantic City Hilton Hotel and renamed it Trump Castle.[65] Both casinos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1992.[66]

Trump bought a third Atlantic City venue in 1988, the Trump Taj Mahal. It was financed with $675 million in junk bonds and completed for $1.1 billion, opening in April 1990.[63] He filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1991. Under the provisions of the restructuring agreement, he gave up half his initial stake and personally guaranteed future performance.[67] To reduce his $900 million of personal debt, he sold the Trump Shuttle airline; his megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been leased to his casinos and kept docked; and other businesses.[68]

In 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of the Trump Plaza.[69] THCR purchased the Taj Mahal and the Trump Castle in 1996 and went bankrupt in 2004 and 2009, leaving him with 10 percent ownership.[63] He remained chairman until 2009.[70]

Clubs
In 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.[71] In 1995, he converted the estate into a private club with an initiation fee and annual dues. He continued to use a wing of the house as a private residence.[72] He declared the club his primary residence in 2019.[55] The Trump Organization began building and buying golf courses in 1999.[73] It owns fourteen and manages another three Trump-branded courses worldwide.[74]

The Trump Organization has licensed the Trump name for consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, learning courses, and home furnishings.[75] According to The Washington Post, there are more than 50 licensing or management deals involving his name, and they have generated at least $59 million in revenue for his companies.[76] By 2018, only two consumer goods companies continued to license his name.[75]

In September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals, a team in the United States Football League. After the 1985 season, the league folded, largely due to his attempt to move to a fall schedule (when it would have competed with the NFL for audience) and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust suit.[77]

Trump and his Plaza Hotel hosted several boxing matches at the Atlantic City Convention Hall.[63][78] In 1989 and 1990, he lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia.[79]

From 1986 to 1988, Trump purchased significant blocks of shares in various public companies while suggesting that he intended to take over the company and then sold his shares for a profit,[80] leading some observers to think he was engaged in greenmail.[81] The New York Times found that he initially made millions of dollars in such stock transactions, but "lost most, if not all, of those gains after investors stopped taking his takeover talk seriously".[80]

In 1988, Trump purchased the Eastern Air Lines Shuttle, financing the purchase with $380 million (equivalent to $979 million in 2023)[47] in loans from a syndicate of 22 banks. He renamed the airline Trump Shuttle and operated it until 1992.[82] He defaulted on his loans in 1991, and ownership passed to the banks.[83]

In 1992, Trump, his siblings Maryanne, Elizabeth, and Robert, and his cousin John W. Walter, each with a 20 percent share, formed All County Building Supply & Maintenance Corp. The company had no offices and is alleged to have been a shell company for paying the vendors providing services and supplies for Trump's rental units, then billing those services and supplies to Trump Management with markups of 20–50 percent and more. The owners shared the proceeds generated by the markups. The increased costs were used to get state approval for increasing the rents of his rent-stabilized units.[84]

In 1996, Trump purchased the Miss Universe pageants, including Miss USA and Miss Teen USA.[85] Due to disagreements with CBS about scheduling, he took both pageants to NBC in 2002.[86][87] In 2007, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as producer of Miss Universe.[88] NBC and Univision dropped the pageants in June 2015 in reaction to Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants.[89]
Trump University
Main article: Trump University
In 2005, Trump co-founded Trump University, a company that sold real estate seminars for up to $35,000. After New York State authorities notified the company that its use of "university" violated state law (as it was not an academic institution), its name was changed to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative in 2010.[90]

In 2013, the State of New York filed a $40 million civil suit against Trump University, alleging that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers. Additionally, two class actions were filed in federal court against Trump and his companies. Internal documents revealed that employees were instructed to use a hard-sell approach, and former employees testified that Trump University had defrauded or lied to its students.[91] Shortly after he won the 2016 presidential election, he agreed to pay a total of $25 million to settle the three cases.[92]

Foundation
Main article: Donald J. Trump Foundation
The Donald J. Trump Foundation was a private foundation established in 1988.[93] From 1987 to 2006, Trump gave his foundation $5.4 million which had been spent by the end of 2006. After donating a total of $65,000 in 2007–2008, he stopped donating any personal funds to the charity,[94] which received millions from other donors, including $5 million from Vince McMahon.[95] The foundation gave to health- and sports-related charities, conservative groups,[96] and charities that held events at Trump properties.[94]

In 2016, The Washington Post reported that the charity committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion.[97] Also in 2016, the New York attorney general determined the foundation to be in violation of state law, for soliciting donations without submitting to required annual external audits, and ordered it to cease its fundraising activities in New York immediately.[98] Trump's team announced in December 2016 that the foundation would be dissolved.[99]

In June 2018, the New York attorney general's office filed a civil suit against the foundation, Trump, and his adult children, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and additional penalties.[100] In December 2018, the foundation ceased operation and disbursed its assets to other charities.[101] In November 2019, a New York state judge ordered Trump to pay $2 million to a group of charities for misusing the foundation's funds, in part to finance his presidential campaign.[102]

Legal affairs and bankruptcies
Main article: Personal and business legal affairs of Donald Trump
According to a review of state and federal court files conducted by USA Today in 2018, Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions.[103] While he has not filed for personal bankruptcy, his over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection six times between 1991 and 2009.[104] They continued to operate while the banks restructured debt and reduced his shares in the properties.[104]

During the 1980s, more than 70 banks had lent Trump $4 billion.[105] After his corporate bankruptcies of the early 1990s, most major banks, with the exception of Deutsche Bank, declined to lend to him.[106] After the January 6 Capitol attack, the bank decided not to do business with him or his company in the future.[107]

In 1982, Trump made the initial Forbes list of wealthy people for holding a share of his family's estimated $200 million net worth (equivalent to $631 million in 2023).[47] His losses in the 1980s dropped him from the list between 1990 and 1995.[108] After filing the mandatory financial disclosure report with the FEC in July 2015, he announced a net worth of about $10 billion. Records released by the FEC showed at least $1.4 billion in assets and $265 million in liabilities.[109] Forbes estimated his net worth dropped by $1.4 billion between 2015 and 2018.[110] In their 2024 billionaires ranking, his net worth was estimated to be $2.3 billion (1,438th in the world).[111]

In 2018, journalist Jonathan Greenberg reported that Trump had called him in 1984 pretending to be a fictional Trump Organization official named "John Barron". Greenberg said that, to get a higher ranking on the Forbes 400 list of wealthy Americans, Trump, speaking as "Barron", falsely asserted that Donald Trump owned more than 90 percent of his father's business. Greenberg also wrote that Forbes had vastly overestimated Trump's wealth and wrongly included him on the 1982, 1983, and 1984 rankings.[112]

Trump has often said he began his career with "a small loan of a million dollars" from his father and that he had to pay it back with interest.[113] He was a millionaire by age eight, borrowed at least $60 million from his father, largely failed to repay those loans, and received another $413 million (2018 dollars adjusted for inflation) from his father's company.[114][84] In 2018, he and his family were reported to have committed tax fraud, and the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance started an investigation.[84] His investments underperformed the stock and New York property markets.[115][116] Forbes estimated in October 2018 that his net worth declined from $4.5 billion in 2015 to $3.1 billion in 2017 and his product-licensing income from $23 million to $3 million.[117]

Trump's tax returns from 1985 to 1994 show net losses totaling $1.17 billion. The losses were higher than those of almost every other American taxpayer. The losses in 1990 and 1991, more than $250 million each year, were more than double those of the nearest taxpayers. In 1995, his reported losses were $915.7 million[80] (equivalent to $1.83 billion in 2023).[47] In March 1987, Trump halved his net worth in a sworn statement to $1.5 billion ($1.9 billion in 2023),[47] but accountants reported his net worth at less than zero[118] or minus $295 million ($791 million in 2023).[47]

In 2020, The New York Times obtained Trump's tax information extending over two decades. Its reporters found that he reported losses of hundreds of millions of dollars. Since 2010 he had also failed to pay back $287 million in loans. During the 15 years prior to 2020, using tax credits for business losses, he paid no income taxes in 10 of those years and $750 each in 2016 and 2017. He balanced his businesses' losses by selling and borrowing against assets, including a $100 million mortgage on Trump Tower (refinanced in 2022) and the liquidation of over $200 million in stocks and bonds. He personally guaranteed $421 million in debt, most of which is due by 2024.[119]

As of October 2021, Trump had over $1.3 billion in debts, much of which was secured by his assets.[120] In 2020, he owed $640 million to banks and trust organizations, including Bank of China, Deutsche Bank, and UBS, and approximately $450 million to unknown creditors. The value of his assets exceeds his debt.[121]
